Only God know which hands will get this project. So, now I'm really inexperienced developer and if u too - keep reading this! 
To start execute u must install Node JS. When u done it - open main folder of this project ('routing') in Terminal and enter:
	
	node server.js

If all is well, u will see a message: listening on port 7000

It means that server have has started working on port 7000. Now u can enter in browser url:
	localhost:7000

I hope u like what u see! XD
